This project aims to develop a Transfer learning-based system for classifying poultry diseases into four categories: Salmonella, New Castle Disease, Coccidiosis, and Healthy. The solution involves creating a robust machine learning model that will be integrated into a mobile application. Farmers will be able to use this application to input data (e.g., symptoms, environmental conditions, and biological samples) and receive an immediate diagnosis along with suggested treatments. The ultimate goal is to provide farmers with a tool that enhances their ability to manage poultry health, thereby reducing disease impact and improving productivity.![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-02 at 21 33 08_9d6fafca](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f42d04a-a5df-4c89-b031-e90530863068)
